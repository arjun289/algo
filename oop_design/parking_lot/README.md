# ParkingLot

## Problem

### Description
A parking lot is a dedicated area that is intended for parking vehicles. Parking 
lots arempresent in every city and suburban area. Shopping malls, stadiums, airports, train stations, and similar venues often feature a parking lot with a large capacity. A parking lot can spread
across multiple buildings with multiple floors or can be in a large open area.
- The parking lot will allow different types of vehicles to be parked:
- Motorcycles/Scooters
- Cars/SUVs
- Buses/Trucks
- Each vehicle will occupy a single spot and the spot size will be different for different
vehicles.
- The number of spots per vehicle type will be different for different parking lots. For
example
- Motorcycles/scooters: 100 spots
- Cars/SUVs: 80 spots
- Buses/Trucks: 40 spots
- When a vehicle is parked, a parking ticket should be generated with the spot number
and the entry date-time.
- When a vehicle is unparked, a receipt should be generated with the entry date-time,
exit date-time, and the applicable fees to be paid.
